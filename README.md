# Sharks
Hello, my name is Jason and this page is a sort of information page about sharks. My son loves them so i thought i might as well do a beginner project page about, well... sharks. If anyone is looking at my code, please remember this a beginner page. I of course welcome any and all comments about content, cleanliness or anything that may help me make a nice page. Thanks.

I am using my Macbook Pro to work on and Visual Studio Code to code. And lots of Google.
